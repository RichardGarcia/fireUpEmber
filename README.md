# fireUpEmber

Ember.js is a highly anticipated framework for writing ambitious client-side web applications. But the initial learning curve can be a bit steep. MVC on the client works differently than it does on a server-based application. Ember can save you from writing a lot of code...but only if you understand how it works and what it expects. This course covers the very latest 1.0.0-pre4 version of Ember in 85 minutes.
